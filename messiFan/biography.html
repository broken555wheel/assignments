            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Lionel Messi, a footballer from Argentina, was born on June 24, 1987. Messi’s passion for football began
                at a young age, and he spent his childhood playing football with his brothers. He joined the youth team
                of Newell’s Old Boys as a young boy and began playing for FC Barcelona’s under-14 team when he was 13.
                Messi’s skills won attention on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and at the age of 13, he moved to
                Barcelona, Spain, to join FC Barcelona’s under-14 team.</p>
            <p>
                He played for FC Barcelona’s under-14 team, quickly graduating through the higher-level teams until his
                informal debut at age 16 with FC Barcelona in a friendly match. Shortly after Messi’s La Masia
                partnership took off in Barcelona, Messi became the youngest player and goal scorer in the Spanish top
                flight in the 2004/05 season. Messi represented the Catalan Giants for 17 seasons before his move to
                Paris Saint-Germain in 2021.
